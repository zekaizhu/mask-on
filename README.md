## mask-on

The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading virally and affecting peopleâ€™s daily life greatly. Wearing a mask in public will help prevent people from spreading the virus.
Our project is using neural network to detects whether a person in the image is wearing a face mask or not and recognizes the mask type (N95 or non-N95) if the image subject is wearing a mask.
